                    Their website contains all relevant information pertaining to the Darkest Dungeon games with each page
                    including links to the store page, dlc, merch, etc. The website's color scheme is well contrasted and 
                    easy to read.

                    The site feels cluttered and not particularly well organized. While it is not bad, it definitely
                    could feel less difficult to navigate.

                    The website is simple and not overwhelming with information at first. The home page contains an overview of the game
                    and the content is pleasing to look at. The white text has a dark background so it is readable on top of the light
                    images.

                    The home page is a little light on information perhaps, but other than that small nitpick there is not much wrong with the website.

                    This site definitely has information about Pacman.

                    The website is a mess to navigate. The colors are overwhelming and it is difficult to tell what is going on.
                    The home page has some news articles, but it doesn't have very much good information about Pacman. There are
                    a few other tabs that are more or less as hard to look at as the home page.
