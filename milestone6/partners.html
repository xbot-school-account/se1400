                    <p>
                        Alright Games brings a dependable, methodical presence to the collaborative process. Their titles, marked by functional design and a firm grasp of 
                        genre fundamentals, consistently meet expectations—sometimes even early. Their games tend to favor clarity over complexity, and while 
                        innovation may not be their primary pursuit, their execution is, undeniably, competent.<br>
                        While our paths diverge in terms of vision, scope, and dimensional volatility, 
                        we recognize the utility of a partner who always delivers exactly what they said they would—and never more. 
                        Alright’s straightforward approach allows XSC to focus on higher-dimensional mechanics and spiritually recursive architectures, 
                        confident that the groundwork will be quietly, efficiently handled. It's a relationship that continues to benefit all parties, especially us.</p>

                <h2>Masochism Inc.</h2>
                <a href="https://kadsper23.github.io/se1400/milestone6" target="_blank"><img class="partner-logo" src="images/maso-inc.png" alt="Masochism Incorporated Logo"></a>
                <p>
                    Masochism Inc. is a studio that operates on the edge of creative extremity, where game design blurs into endurance ritual. 
                    Their projects are harrowing in both theme and execution—demanding, unrelenting, and eerily meticulous. Working with them 
                    often feels less like collaboration and more like being pulled into something... deeper. Something that watches back. <br>
                    XSC respects their singular vision, even if we don't always understand the methods behind it—or the silence that follows 
                    their internal meetings. While our teams tend to prefer structured chaos and controlled recursion, Masochism Inc. brings 
                    a raw, almost confrontational energy that we have learned to approach with both admiration and caution. We’re proud to partner with them—when we must.</p>
