                        Frequently Asked Questions
                    </h2>
                    <dl>
                        <dt>What does XSC stand for?</dt>
                        <dd>
                            This is an interesting question to answer, as the XS does not translate directly from our native language.
                            Unfortunately, we cannot legally provide an answer to this question as it would cause bodily harm.
                        </dd>
                        <br>
                        <dt>Where can I buy XSC consoles like LUDOS or OmniLoop 0?</dt>
                        <dd>
                            All of our consoles are avaliable for purchase from vendors that can be found just outside your nearest continuity node.
                        </dd>
                        <br>
                        <dt>Are your games meant to be winnable?</dt>
                        <dd>
                            We may not agree on everything, but we and Masochism Inc agree that some games are not meant to be won. It's up to the consumer to determine how far they want to go.
                        </dd>
                        <br>
                        <dt>Can I mod your games?</dt>
                        <dd>Some people are so preoccupied with whether or not they can that they don't stop to think about whether they should.</dd>
                        <br>
                        <dt>Why won't XSC release their source code?</dt>
                        <dd>Fun fact! We used to release all of our source code until the US Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center told us we had to stop!</dd>
                        <br>
                        <dt>Who designed the LUDOS UI, and why does it know my name?</dt>
                        <dd>If the LUDOS UI knows your name, maybe it's someone you know.</dd>
                        <br>
                        <dt>Why does my Chitinbox occasionally reboot into something called “The Harrowed Interface”?</dt>
                        <dd>If your Chitinbox reboots in the The Harrowed Interface, please report this to XSC immediately.
                            We will dispatch an Incident Response Unit and your surviving family will recieve compensation from XSC.
                        </dd>
                        <br>
                        <dt>Do you actually read these questions, or is this FAQ recursive?</dt>
                        <dd>EXCEPTION: CANNOT PROVIDE RESPONSE. FLAGGED INPUT: 'null'<dd>

                    <h2>How to Contact Us</h2>
                    <h3>Tech Support</h3>
                    <p>
                        To report issues with LUDOS, OMNILOOP 0, or any XSC software, please initiate a Level-2 EchoLink Request via your console’s diagnostic 
                        shell or any functioning Dreamwave-compatible interface. If you are not near a console, submit your request using an EchoGlyph.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Media and Press</h3>
                    <p>XSC maintains a non-opt-in relationship with the press. We neither solicit coverage nor tolerate it without calibration. If you insist on contacting us for media purposes, 
                        you must first pass through the Controlled Access via Image Gate (C.A.I.G.). Following are the steps required to initiate a C.A.I.G. request.
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Acquire a printed image of any XSC device or game artifact. The image must be physically inverted (upside down) and viewed through a mirror.</li>
                        <li>Annotate the image using a felt-tip pen with blue or lesser pigments, marking the following phrase precisely at the center: "We See Because We Were Shown"</li>
                        <li>Burn the annotated image using flame sourced from an electrical fire. Capture the burn in exactly 8 frames on analog film.</li>
                        <li>Encode the film into a .raw byte array using any operating system that predates 2007.</li>
                        <li>Upload the resulting file via our Legacy Relay Portal, accessible only by redirecting your IP to a deprecated DNS node maintained by a defunct Czech ISP (access string available only through entropic pingback; contact tech support if you need help).</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Once we have received and examined your C.A.I.G. Artifact, a reply will be rendered either in the form of a silence or a dream of metal wind.</p>
                    <p class="fine-print">Please note: submitting a media inquiry without proper ritual binding may result in reflective noise bleeding into your personal memories.</p>

                    <p>For anything else, hold your left hand over a powered-off screen and hum at a consistent pitch until you feel mild warmth. If the screen blinks or distorts, your message has been received. This method is not recommended for those with pacemakers, doubts, or unresolved guilt.</p>
